Based on the provided information, it's hard to determine the exact cause of the test failure as the actual DOM content is incomplete. However, assuming that the test is failing because the element with the class `.new-todo` is not found, here is a potential analysis and fix:

```json
{
  "analysis": {
    "issue": "The test is failing because the element with the class '.new-todo' is not found in the DOM.",
    "cause": "The selector '.new-todo' does not match any element in the actual DOM content."
  },
  "fix": {
    "old": "cy.get('.new-todo')",
    "new": "cy.get('INSERT_CORRECT_SELECTOR_HERE')"
  }
}
```

Please replace `INSERT_CORRECT_SELECTOR_HERE` with the correct selector that matches the element in the actual DOM content. You might need to inspect the actual web page or consult with the development team to get the correct selector.
