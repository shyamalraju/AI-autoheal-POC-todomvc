The test is trying to type 'Demo' into this non-existent element and then press enter. After that, it's trying to find the 'Demo' text in another non-existent element with the class '.main .todo-list .view'.\",\n  \"fix\": \"The exact fix would depend on the actual structure of the DOM. However, the selectors '.new-todo' and '.main .todo-list .view' should be replaced with the correct selectors that point to the elements that the test is trying to interact with. For example, if the input field has an id of 'todo-input' and the list of todos has an id of 'todo-list', the corrected test would look like this:\n\n```javascript\nit('should create new todo', () => {\n  cy.visit('/');\n  cy.contains('h1', 'todos');\n\n  cy.get('#todo-input')\n    .type('Demo')\n    .type('{enter}');\n\n  cy.get('#todo-list').contains('Demo');\n});\n```\n\nThis is just an example.
