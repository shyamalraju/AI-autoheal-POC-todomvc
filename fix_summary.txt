📄 File: tests/e2e/new-todo.spec.js
📍 Location: Line 50, Column 7
🔍 Old Code: cy.contains('h1', 'todos')
✨ New Code: cy.contains('h1', "todo's")
📝 Reason: The test is failing because the expected text 'todos' does not match the actual text 'todo's' in the DOM. The test needs to be updated to look for the correct text.
