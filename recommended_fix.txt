  "code": {
    "old": "cy.get('.main .todo-list .view').contains('Demo');",
    "new": "cy.get('.new-todo').should('have.value', 'Demo');"
  },
  "explanation": "The code is updated to check if the input field with the class '.new-todo' has the value 'Demo'. This is a more reliable way to check if the todo item was created, as it does not rely on the structure of the todo list, which is not present in the actual DOM content."
