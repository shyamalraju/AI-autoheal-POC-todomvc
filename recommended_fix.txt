The exact fix depends on the actual structure of the full DOM. If the class name has been changed, the fix would be to update the class name in the test. If the element is now identified by an id or some other attribute, the fix would be to use that instead. For example, if the element is now identified by an id 'new-todo', the fix would be to change the line 'cy.get('.new-todo')' to 'cy.get('#new-todo')'. If the class name is correct and the element is not being rendered before the test runs, the fix would be to add a wait for the element to be visible before trying to interact with it. This could be done by adding 'cy.get('.new-todo').should('be.visible')' before the line 'cy.get('.new-todo')'.
