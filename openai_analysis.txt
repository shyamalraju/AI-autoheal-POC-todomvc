  "analysis": "The test is failing because the selector '.main .todo-list .view' is not found in the actual DOM content. This could be due to a change in the structure of the DOM or the class names. The test is trying to find a todo item with the text 'Demo' but the DOM content provided does not contain any todo items.",
  "fix": "Without the full DOM content, it's hard to provide an exact fix. However, the selector should be updated to match the current structure and class names of the todo items in the DOM. If the class names have not changed, ensure that the todo item is actually being created before trying to select it. If the structure has changed, update the selector to match the new structure. For example, if the todo items are now under a '.todos' class instead of '.main .todo-list .view', the code should be updated as follows: cy.get('.todos').contains('Demo');"
