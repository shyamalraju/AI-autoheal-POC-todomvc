Without the full DOM content, it's hard to provide an exact fix. However, the selector should be updated to match the current structure and class names of the todo items in the DOM. If the class names have not changed, ensure that the todo item is actually being created before trying to select it. If the structure has changed, update the selector to match the new structure. For example, if the todo items are now under a '.todos' class instead of '.main .todo-list .view', the code should be updated as follows: cy.get('.todos').contains('Demo');
